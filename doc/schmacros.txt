*schmacros.txt*    Plugin to manage macros "schmacros"

==============================================================================
DESCRIPTION                                                        *schmacros*

This is just a simple and silly attempt to try and understand how you 
make a neovim plugin and perhaps I could also manage my macros along 
with this plugin attempt. Mostly created because I create a macro and
I can never remember exactly where I put it or what it does. So - here 
we go...


==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                  *schmacros-commands*

:Schmacros       Show the list of my "schmacros"                   *Schmacros*

This will let you display all of the managed macros to a popup window
that you can easly close with "q" or "<esc>"

:SchmacrosYank   Garb a macro from register                    *SchmacrosYank*

This will let you yank a macro from you register by letter:

:SchmacrosYank x

Will yank the macro stored in registry "x" and place it in a 
system buffer ready for 'pasting'.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                              *schmacros-config*

You can configure it using Lazy.nvim like this:

	{
		"wbelser/schmacros.nvim",
		opts = {
            -- macro one --
			{
				reg = "l",
				macro = "0i[<Esc>A]()<Esc>",
				desc = "Markdown link",
				ft = "markdown", -- perhaps a filetype?
			},
            -- macro two --
			{
				reg = "q",
				macro = 'di"<esc>pa"',
				desc = 'Quote (") visual',
			},
		},
		-- cmd = "Schmacros",
	},
